Wine 1

If you appreciate a wine that's developing beautifully and exhibiting the complexity that great wines show as they mature, then look no further. A blend based on Tempranillo with 10% Graciano and 5% Mazuelo, this offers gorgeous evocations of dried plum, fig, pressed flowers and leather. The tannins have softened to velvety perfection and there's still plenty of verve here. With its effortless charm, this is a subtly nuanced wine posing as a crowd-pleaser. Savour it with cured or braised meats or stuffed mushrooms. (Vintages panel, July 2018)

Wine 1

Cave de Cairanne was founded in 1929. Their 2017 La Reserve Plan de Dieu is a blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah. The grapes were harvested and fermented separately before being blended together at the end of the winter and further aged for 8 months in concrete.

(Vintages panel, June 2018)

Wine 2

Saturated, deep black-red in colour with a pure, exuberant and exciting scent mingling notes of smoke, bramble, blackberry, blackcurrant and redcurrant.  The flavours are joyful.  There's a fruit core of singing lyricism, both vivid and fresh without being acidulous; the wine is tannic enough to give its fruit shape and gravitas but not roughness or austerity; and it has overtones which bring light and shade to the wine via faint notes of smoke, of cleansing bitterness, of the saltiness which is such a hallmark of parts of Crozes, and of the 'stony' flavours which lovers of terroir wine crave.  A gorgeous success. Score - 93. (Andrew Jefford, decanter.com, July 18, 2016)

Wine 2

You know those bottles that bring you to your knees? This is one of them. Backstory: One of the better wine agencies in Toronto, Halpern Enterprises, went to California to scout a $20 Cab that kills it - and they came back with this very serious find. With a crushed velvet mouth feel - all polished on top and plush underneath - this wine draws you in with flavours of ripe mixed berries, café latte, smoked plum, milk chocolate, toasted tobacco and vanilla cream. Elegant yet slightly brooding, this wine is a steal.  Score - 96. (Carolyn Evans Hammond, Toronto Star, July 6, 2018)

Here they aim for black fruit character while the regular Roda should show red fruit. The grapes are sourced from over 30-year-old vines and is mostly Tempranillo with some 5% Graciano. It matured in first and second use French oak barrels for 16 months. It's a warm vintage, without reaching the heights of 2011, but there was some stress in the peak of the summer, which in some wines might have provided some dry tannins. The advantage of old vines is that they are able to absorb these effects. There was some rain in September that might have saved the vintage. In general, everybody talks about a very healthy vintage, but again the challenge is to keep the freshness. The nose shows those aromas of thyme and rosemary, with dark fruit, ripe and a bit heady. The palate is truly spicy, voluptuous and full, with dusty, fine tannins and a tasty finish. 99,661 bottles produced. Drink Date: 2016-2022. Score - 93.

Wine 1

Saturated, deep black-red in colour with a pure, exuberant and exciting scent mingling notes of smoke, bramble, blackberry, blackcurrant and redcurrant.  The flavours are joyful.  There's a fruit core of singing lyricism, both vivid and fresh without being acidulous; the wine is tannic enough to give its fruit shape and gravitas but not roughness or austerity; and it has overtones which bring light and shade to the wine via faint notes of smoke, of cleansing bitterness, of the saltiness which is such a hallmark of parts of Crozes, and of the 'stony' flavours which lovers of terroir wine crave.

Winemaker and GM Christophe Paubert grew up in the Sauternes region of Bordeaux, and worked four years at Chateau d'Yquem and other New World regions before coming to Stags Leap. There is typical Napa generosity, richness and softness here, with a lovely nose of chocolate, bumbleberry pie and subtle merlot dried herbs/tea.

From a large, single vineyard in cooler Carneros where moderate merlot often ripens well, this has a generous, floral, plummy, typical merlot nose of plum and blackberry with chocolate and some smoke from oak ageing. It is full bodied yet quite delicate and elegant with fine tannin. Very good definition here, with cab sauv and cab franc in the blend combining to add some tension. Score - 91.

The 2014 Malartic-Lagravière is a gorgeous wine, but it is also flamboyant and exotic, especially in its flavor profile. Super-ripe red cherry and plum make a strong first impression. Sweet floral and spice notes, along with ripe, silky tannins, add to the wine's sensuality. A rich, powerful wine with soft contours and striking depth, the 2014 is a real beauty. It will be even more compelling once the new oak tannins soften a bit further. The blend is 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. Tasted two times.

You can't go wrong with the Southern Rhône, which is on a roll with a string of outstanding vintages. This juicy blend from the celebrated Perrin family is a gem, with ripe red berry fruit and spice notes. Delicious with Mediterranean-style pizza or hearty lamb stew.

Wine 3

Cave de Cairanne was founded in 1929. Their 2017 La Reserve Plan de Dieu is a blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah. The grapes were harvested and fermented separately before being blended together at the end of the winter and further aged for 8 months in concrete. This is a finely balanced wine with violet, plum, blackberry, cedar and vanilla notes and a savoury tinge that adds complexity to the finish. Try this with roasted meats or turkey burgers. (Vintages panel, June 2018)

Input)

Saturated, deep black-red in colour with a pure, exuberant and exciting scent mingling notes of smoke, bramble, blackberry, blackcurrant and redcurrant.  The flavours are joyful.  There's a fruit core of singing lyricism, both vivid and fresh without being acidulous; the wine is tannic enough to give its fruit shape and gravitas but not roughness or austerity; and it has overtones which bring light and shade to the wine via faint notes of smoke, of cleansing bitterness, of the saltiness which is such a hallmark of parts of Crozes, and of the 'stony' flavours which lovers of terroir wine crave.  A gorgeous success. Score - 93. (Andrew Jefford, decanter.com, July 18, 2016)

Recommendation 67


Wine 1

While the wine is no more than medium-bodied, it has life and lift that immediately grab attention, allied with a seductive mix of red and blackcurrant fruit, oak spice and dried bay leaf.

Wine 1

California has a world-class reputation for great cabernet sauvignon, and this luscious example does not disappoint. It brims with aromas of ripe berries, mocha and violets that lead to flavours of cassis and chocolate-covered cherries and ends in a smooth finish with a hint of spice. Enjoy with grilled steak or on its own.

You know those bottles that bring you to your knees? This is one of them. Backstory: One of the better wine agencies in Toronto, Halpern Enterprises, went to California to scout a $20 Cab that kills it - and they came back with this very serious find. With a crushed velvet mouth feel - all polished on top and plush underneath - this wine draws you in with flavours of ripe mixed berries, café latte, smoked plum, milk chocolate, toasted tobacco and vanilla cream. Elegant yet slightly brooding, this wine is a steal.  Score - 96. (Carolyn Evans Hammond, Toronto Star, July 6, 2018)

Recommendation 73


Wine 1

The single-vineyard 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Sugarille has a tighter core and a blacker heart compared to the Rennina. This wine is momentarily more difficult to penetrate and comprehend. It makes a more abrupt first impression but then relaxes and reveals more of its character only after it has spent extra time in your company. Then, it becomes suddenly exuberant and loud. This is a dynamic expression of Sangiovese with bold ripe fruit, spice and balsam notes to carry it forward during cellar aging. This vintage offers firmness and strength. Drink Date: 2020-2037.  Score - 94. (Monica Larner, robertparker.com, Feb. 28, 2018)

Wine 2

The 2012 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Poggio al Vento is a monumental wine from this storied appellation in southern Tuscany. From a warm vintage, this is a deeply textured, rich and succulent rendition of Sangiovese. You taste the exuberant flavors of sun-drenched fruit. However, you also taste some evolution (remember, we are talking about a wine released seven years after the harvest) with tarry notes of toasted spice, licorice and Spanish cedar. This wine ages in large oak casks (of various sizes) for four years followed by an additional two years in bottle. We can look forward to more bottle evolution as the wine moves forward in time. Some 20,000 bottles were made. Drink Date: 2020-2040.  Score - 95. (Monica Larner, robertparker.com, Jan. 31, 2019)

Made with fruit from a slightly cooler site, the 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Filo di Seta takes a few minutes to open but is well worth the wait. Despite the tight and nervous character of Sangiovese, this wine is suddenly generous, opulent and exuberant all at once. It's like meeting a person for the first time who initially seems shy, but then who suddenly moves in for the big bear hug. Its disposition is as generous as it is genuine. The mouthfeel is textured, supple and warm. Drink Date: 2020-2035.  Score - 94. (Monica Larner, robertparker.com, Feb. 28, 2018)

There are few Brunello vintages afforded more attention in the last 10-plus, certainly '04 and '06, increasingly better even from '08 and looking forward towards what greatness will come in 2015. Yes but not solely magnified through the lens of patience and bottle time, from 2010 La Mannella has coupled upon and layered over itself like compressed fruit and puff pastry. Though it begs for drink now attention, another seven years will be needed before it can safely be labeled as uncoiled and to reveal all that is wrapped so tight. Rich is not the operative but unmistakeable as Cortonesi it is; that natural clay soil funk of resolution and fully hydrated chalk. This is to sangiovese as Les Preuses Grand Cru Chablis or Rangen Grand Cru Alsace are to Riesling. It carries in its pocket the absolute meaning and genetic responsibility of where it comes from, with a curative and restorative ability to get you lost. Drink: 2019-2031. Tasted February 2017.

A little juicier and riper than what you may expect from Ontario if you're used to drinking Red from Niagara. It's fantastic when you see the Lake Erie North Shore appellation on the bottle.

From the Niagara wine region in Ontario, Creekside's Laura's 2016 is a full-bodied Bordeaux blend of Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon with 2% Syrah added into the mix and showing a lot of promise. On the nose field berries, wet stone, chocolate, earthiness and hint of vanilla. There's plenty of acidity for food and some warming alcohol on the palate. Long toasted oak and cherry finish. Decant and drink now or hold in cellar for three to five years. Food pairings: tourtière, lamburger, pork pies. Drink 2019-2023. Score - 90. (Natalie MacLean, nataliemaclean.com, May 13, 2019)

Great value young ripe and fruity Rhone red. Visually it is a deep ruby colour, while on the nose there is red cherry, raspberry, anise and light spice. Palate is dry, medium bodied and balanced. Immediately appealing from the first sip, showing flavours of ripe raspberry, plum and red fruit with notes of earth and spice.

Over 130 years old, Spain's Torres Winery almost single-handedly established the now-famous Penedès wine region. Intense redcurrant and plum, plus coffee bean flavours, with silky tannins. Pair with spicy beef fajitas, empanadas, filet mignon or grilled lamb.

Wine 2

The 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon Feather is lovely, unfurling in the glass with aromas of cassis, blackberries, petroleum jelly and burning embers. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ripe and powerful, with an expansive attack and an ample core of dark berry fruit, underpinned by a fine-grained, stony chassis of ripe tannins. This wine is made by Howell Mountain veteran Randy Dunn, and its profile - while marked by the torrid 2015 vintage - will be familiar to followers of the wines he produces there.

The aromatic and perfumed Bobal 2014 Rayuelo clearly called my attention. It had fragrant notes of violets not often found in the variety, which can sometimes be a little too rustic. It also has a lot of freshness while being juicy, and the oak is nicely integrated after some time in bottle. It matured in barrel for eight months but has been in bottle since June 2016.

The 'black label' vineyards are situated in Pacs del Penedès, close to Vilafranca: 29ha of unirrigated Cabernet Sauvignon on alluvial soils over sand and clay, generally harvested at the end of September ... It's dark in colour, fragrant and enticing on the nose, and svelte, poised and finally melting on the palate ... the fruits have a rounded unction - it has more texture and structural depth as well as refinement. It's very 'solar' and Mediterranean, yet there's a rich fleshiness to this Cabernet ... Drink 2018-2030. Score - 94. (Andrew Jefford, decanter.com, June 24, 2018)

The 2016 Cabernet Sauvignon L'Esprit des Pavots is a dense, rich second wine that takes fruit from both Les Pavots and Au Paradis, Peter Michael's estate vineyard in Oakville. Dark cherry, plum, chocolate, new leather, licorice and spice are pushed forward in a succulent, racy wine that will drink well right out of the gate. This is the first vintage in which Les Pavots is a blend of fruit from both estate vineyards. The blend is 34% Cabernet Sauvignon, 29% Merlot, 28% Cabernet Franc and 9% Petit Verdot.

The 2016 The Big Easy is fabulous. Rich, powerful and flamboyant to its core the Big Easy hits the palate with tremendous fruit intensity. Super-ripe red cherry, raspberry jam, white chocolate, vanillin and new American oak shape this opulent Syrah/Petite Sirah/ Grenache blend.

If you were to come back as a vine, Jerry Seps's steep hillside vineyard would be a pretty tempting place to put down roots. His vineyard faces north toward Mount St. Helena and east toward the Palisades?not a house or a road in sight, only trees, meadows and craggy rocks left by the volcano. Ideally, you'd come back as a zinfandel vine. The vineyard's cool morning sun and volcanic soils grow zin with racy energy, a sensation that's captured beautifully in this 2013. With air, the wine transforms all of its blueberry flavor, peachy red fruit and youthful oak into something finer, opening over the course of several days toward mouthwatering flavors of fresh-picked black raspberries and bright, rustic mineral notes that seem patterned after the volcanic rock.

Winemaker Alexandrine Roy selected the finest 15 barrels of wines made from estate fruit in 2014 for this wine. Harvest Brix 23.8º. Clones are Pommard, 115 and 777. Native yeast fermentation. Aged in French oak barrels, 25% new. Moderately light reddish purple color in the glass. The nose is remarkably complex, offering scents of dark red and black cherry and berry, rose petal, aged leather, and turned earth. A noticeable contrast to the 'Beehive' bottling, with more structure, more savory and earthy facets, less flashy fruit, and slightly more oak contribution at this young age. A very sophisticated wine that is clearly built to age. The mid weight flavors of black raspberry and blackberry are set off by notes of spice and toast and emerge slowly in the glass over time. The finish is uncommonly generous as all great wines are. When tasted several hours later, the wine was more giving, indicating that it should be decanted if drunk now, but will benefit from more time in the cellar. Still evolving when tasted from an opened bottle two days later. Enjoy this one for its complexity and longevity.  Score - 96. (William Gaffney, princeofpinot.com, Feb. 1, 2017)

The 2014 Malartic-Lagravière is a gorgeous wine, but it is also flamboyant and exotic, especially in its flavor profile. Super-ripe red cherry and plum make a strong first impression. Sweet floral and spice notes, along with ripe, silky tannins, add to the wine's sensuality. A rich, powerful wine with soft contours and striking depth, the 2014 is a real beauty. It will be even more compelling once the new oak tannins soften a bit further. The blend is 52% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Petit Verdot. Tasted two times.
