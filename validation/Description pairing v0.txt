Cubillo, like Tondonia and Bosconia, is a single vineyard wine that's always sold as a Crianza but can 'keep for 20 years', according to María José López de Heredia. Made with a classic blend of Tempranillo with 20% Garnacha and 10% Mazuelo and Graciano, it has mint and dried herb notes and a patina of sweet vanilla oak. Drink Date: 2019-2025. Score - 91.

Wine 3

The 2011 Gran Reserva was never going to scale the same heights as the 2010 (it's a vintage thing), but it comes very close. Showing little sign of the heat of the growing season, this combines Tempranillo with Garnacha and Graciano to stylish effect. The oak just needs time to melt into the wine. Drink Date: 2019-2025.

Like the 2011 - the first of two back-to-back warm vintages in Rioja, this 2012 has 10% Graciano to provide acidity and freshness for the Tempranillo.

Wine 1

Cave de Cairanne was founded in 1929. Their 2017 La Reserve Plan de Dieu is a blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah. The grapes were harvested and fermented separately before being blended together at the end of the winter and further aged for 8 months in concrete. This is a finely balanced wine with violet, plum, blackberry, cedar and vanilla notes and a savoury tinge that adds complexity to the finish. Try this with roasted meats or turkey burgers. (Vintages panel, June 2018)

Wine 2

While no 2016s were submitted, the 2017s look to be brilliant wines pretty much across the board. Exotic, with lots of spice, sappy green herbs, flowers, and orange peel notes, the 2017 Côtes du Rhône Première Côte is medium-bodied, fresh and elegant on the palate. It's not a powerhouse yet has finesse and elegance. The blend is 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and the rest Mourvèdre, brought up all in concrete tanks. Score - 88-90.

If 2015 was 3000 per cent better as a vintage compared to 2014 (which was de-classified) than where does that put Apostolos Thymiopoulos' 2016? Well for one thing the vines are another year older, no longer babies and gifting youthful, still charmingly volatile but now maturing adolescent fruit. There is a new layer in the cherries and the pinot noir-like ethereal character but there too is this new gear, savoury, as if ripened pods of sweet (liquorice-accented) carob are falling into your hand, straight from the tree. This Young Vines is getable in ways it has not been before. You gotta drink here. Drink 2018-2021.  Score - 90. (Michael Godel, winealign.com, June 5, 2018)

LENS (Lake Erie North Shore) has a long growing season that permits the grapes to develop ripe, full-flavoured fruit while maintaining the balance integral to fine wines. The warm temperatures allow winemakers in LENS a great range of varietals to work with. Syrah, which loves the sun and warmth, thrives there. This one is soft and approachable, with complex suggestions of red and black fruit, chocolate, toast, cured meat and black pepper spice. Perfect for burgers or ribs. (Vintages panel, March 2018)

Tasted at the Cru Bourgeois annual tasting, the 2015 Chateau l'Argenteyre has an attractive bouquet with blackberry, bilberry, sous bois and tobacco scents that gain intensity with aeration. The palate is medium-bodied with supple tannin, good structure and an insistent grip on the finish that is backed up by clean and fresh fruit.

Wine 1

Coming from three different sectors in the appellation, the 2016 Crozes Hermitage Les Calendes is a step up and offers a fresher, more vibrant style with notes of black raspberries, crushed rocks, violets, and peppery herbs.

Wine 2

From granitic sites around Malleval and Saint-Désirat, the 2015 Saint Joseph l'Arzelle is a terrific effort. This medium to full-bodied wine boasts bushels of blueberries, touches of pepper and licorice, a creamy-supple texture and a long, silky finish. It should have a wide window of drinkability. Drink Date: 2018-2030. Score - 93. (Joe Czerwinski, robertparker.com, Dec. 29, 2017)

Wine 3

Saturated, deep black-red in colour with a pure, exuberant and exciting scent mingling notes of smoke, bramble, blackberry, blackcurrant and redcurrant.  The flavours are joyful.  There's a fruit core of singing lyricism, both vivid and fresh without being acidulous; the wine is tannic enough to give its fruit shape and gravitas but not roughness or austerity; and it has overtones which bring light and shade to the wine via faint notes of smoke, of cleansing bitterness, of the saltiness which is such a hallmark of parts of Crozes, and of the 'stony' flavours which lovers of terroir wine crave.  A gorgeous success. Score - 93. (Andrew Jefford, decanter.com, July 18, 2016)

100% Syrah, from a 40ha estate that is one of the biggest in the appellation. The 2013 vintage in the Rhône is a very different story from Bordeaux, as clearly displayed here.

(Translated from the Spanish) The 2017 harvest was warm in all of the Central Valley and also in Colchagua, and this can possibly be noted in the texture of this wine, which is unctuous and gentle, but the herbal and mineral flavors (such as ash, perhaps) speak of something else: in the mouth these notes of ash are shown together with red fruits and pull off a party-like freshness, with a lively and juicy acidity.

Selected parcels of grapes from the best sites of the vineyard are individually fermented and matured separately for 20-24 months in French barriques, the best barrels blended and held in bottle for another year before release. This is a compelling wine, its quality coming through the bouquet and perfectly balanced and long medium-bodied palate.

Savour it over the next decade alongside beef tenderloin with rosemary and wild mushrooms. (Vintages panel, April 2018)

The 2015 vintage was considered excellent across Bordeaux, making wines from satellite appellations, such as this one, shrewd purchases. This 100% Merlot offers layers of woodsmoke, plum, dark cherry and currant aromas. The lovely smoky fruit is echoed on the sleek, elegant palate, which culminates in a tightly structured finish.

It fermented in stainless steel and matured in French barriques for six months. 2016 is a cooler year than 2014 or 2015, and the wines reflect it. It was not an easy year; they had to do a strict selection of grapes, and it paid off. It has the character of the variety, with its elegant rusticity with a fresh, herbal twist and a palate with fine-grained tannins, nicely textured and with a supple, very tasty finish.

Wine 1

The tight and somehow austere 2013 Las Sabias was produced with grapes from old, ungrafted vines fermented in open cement vats followed by an élevage of 16-18 months in 225- and 500-liter French oak barrels. Proprietor Anthony Terryn told me he thinks the cold years in Toro tend to produce wines that are closer to those from Ribera del Duero. The nose is subtle and elegant, a little shy (I tasted in the cold cellar) with nicely integrated oak. The palate revealed very fine tannins and good acidity, serious and proportioned, focused and with a nice, long and tasty finish. 6,852 bottles were bottled in June 2015. This is young, and should develop and improve slowly in bottle. I tasted the 2008 to check the evolution, and it's feeling fresher and developing complexity, bouquet and nuances, which is the challenge with these very powerful Toros. I very much like the style of this 2013. Drink Date: 2017-2025. Score - 93. (Luis Gutiérrez, robertparker.com, Feb. 28, 2017 )

There is a new single-vineyard red, produced with fruit from a very old vineyard in Valtuille that gives the 2015 El Valao its name. The vineyard produced a fresher wine with more acidity, so they decided to keep it separate. 2015 is the first vintage. The wine fermented in 1,000-liter stainless steel vats and matured in used 225-liter French oak barrels. It has a floral and young nose, still somehow marked by the élevage, but with good stuffing and balance to integrate it in a few more months in bottle.

The eponymous red 2015 Prieto Pariente is a 50/50 blend of Tempranillo and Garnacha from a warm, healthy vintage when they had to harvest earlier to keep the acidity and avoid overripeness. The two varieties fermented separately with indigenous yeasts in 2,500-liter vats after a four-day cold soak. Halfway through the fermentation, it was pressed and put to finish fermentation in 300-liter oak barrels without skins. Malolactic is in barrel and the aging was extended until bottling in September 2016. It had aromas of very high ripeness, dried plums and nuts, and some tree bark-like aromas that gave it a rustic profile with some beeswax and honey undertones. It's a little earthy, and the palate revealed some earthy, somehow rustic tannins. Drink Date: 2017-2020.  Score - 90. (Luis Gutiérrez, robertparker.com, Feb. 28, 2017)

If 2008 felt cool and Atlantic, the 2009 Roda I could be described as Mediterranean, from a warm and healthy vintage. Here they aim for black fruit character while the regular Roda should show red fruit. The grapes are sourced from over 30-year-old vines and is mostly Tempranillo with some 5% Graciano. It matured in first and second use French oak barrels for 16 months. It's a warm vintage, without reaching the heights of 2011, but there was some stress in the peak of the summer, which in some wines might have provided some dry tannins. The advantage of old vines is that they are able to absorb these effects. There was some rain in September that might have saved the vintage. In general, everybody talks about a very healthy vintage, but again the challenge is to keep the freshness. The nose shows those aromas of thyme and rosemary, with dark fruit, ripe and a bit heady. The palate is truly spicy, voluptuous and full, with dusty, fine tannins and a tasty finish. 99,661 bottles produced. Drink Date: 2016-2022. Score - 93.

Wine 1

This is one of the more elegant and satisfyingly dark expressions of Pinot Noir in its price range, starting with aromas of sugarplum, hibiscus, dark berries, crushed slate and moist earth.

The outstanding 2015 vintage is being praised as an instant classic for red Bordeaux, producing wines with immediate appeal and plenty of character. This one is structured yet supple and beautifully harmonious, with rich raspberry wrapped in fine tannins and elevated by juicy acidity. Savour through 2025 with roasted meats.

This wine is crafted from the younger vines in vineyards that produce the wine of a 'mystery' top-flight Pauillac producer. This 2014 is rich, dense and tight-knit. It offers impressive smoky black fruit in a balanced package. The tannins here are considerable and will support cellaring. Follow this for 3-5 years. The producer may not identify itself, but this wine's provenance is clear. (Vintages panel, Nov. 2017)

Always a welcome sight on Vintages shelves, the Delheim Shiraz is a great example of nuanced, supple Stellenbosch Shiraz. It features ripe dark cherry and plum framed by spice, vanilla and smoke.

The palate brings together black cherry, crushed raspberry, fig, licorice and black tea supported by bracing tannins and fresh acidity. Give this time to develop more complexity. Best after 2018.  Score - 93. (Kerin O'Keefe, Wine Enthusiast, Oct. 1, 2014)

Wine 2

Aglianicos from Taurasi are famously ageable, but though they can be quite tannic when young, they can be approached early. In some circles, Taurasi is referred to as the Barolo of the south - high praise indeed, but the wines more than hold their own in this comparison. This one is loaded with plum, black cherry, red fruit, tobacco and oak spice with smooth, high-toned tannins. A real food wine. Try it with grilled sausages or barbecued lamb. (Vintages panel, May 2017)

Wine 3

Elegant, leading off with perfumed aromas of rose, cherry, strawberry and white pepper. The profile is sleek, with a solid base of acidity and tannins.

Another great Pinot from Norman Hardie, one of Ontario's best producers. The 2016 Unfiltered Niagara Pinot Noir straddles the Light- and Medium-bodied categories. Lifted floral notes with cedar, raspberry, cherry, earth and spice in a lithe, elegant, seamless package. A touch of mineral dots the i's and crosses the t's on the layered, complex finish.

Recommendation 65


Wine 1

There is evidence that Nebbiolo, the grape variety behind such wines as Barolo and Barbaresco, has been used to make wine since the 13th century. This wine exhibits equal parts delicacy and structure and offers leafy tobacco and red fruit character. Sip over the next five years with roast beef and mushrooms. (Vintages panel, July 2018)

Wine 2

This winery is located in the heart of the beautiful landscape of rolling hills called Langhe (a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2014), flanked by the Alps. From that stunning terrain springs this equally stunning wine: a full, richly flavoured Barbaresco showing suggestions of berries and cherry along with spicy and herbal notes. Savour it with roast meats and wild mushrooms, or a selection of aged cheeses. (Vintages panel, July 2018)

Wine 3

Made wholly with Nebbiolo, this opens with earthy aromas of crushed herb, star anise, menthol and woodland berry.

Made from the Nebbiolo grape of Barolo and Barbaresco fame, this wine is grown in limestone-rich hillside vineyards and matured in oak for eight months. It's solidly structured, balanced and quite elegant, with plenty of tangy red fruit character. A nice choice for cured meats and firm cheeses. (Vintages panel, July 2018)

Recommendation 66


Wine 1

Cave de Cairanne was founded in 1929. Their 2017 La Reserve Plan de Dieu is a blend of Grenache, Carignan and Syrah. The grapes were harvested and fermented separately before being blended together at the end of the winter and further aged for 8 months in concrete. This is a finely balanced wine with violet, plum, blackberry, cedar and vanilla notes and a savoury tinge that adds complexity to the finish. Try this with roasted meats or turkey burgers. (Vintages panel, June 2018)

Wine 2

You can't go wrong with the Southern Rhône, which is on a roll with a string of outstanding vintages. This juicy blend from the celebrated Perrin family is a gem, with ripe red berry fruit and spice notes. Delicious with Mediterranean-style pizza or hearty lamb stew.

Input)

Saturated, deep black-red in colour with a pure, exuberant and exciting scent mingling notes of smoke, bramble, blackberry, blackcurrant and redcurrant.  The flavours are joyful.  There's a fruit core of singing lyricism, both vivid and fresh without being acidulous; the wine is tannic enough to give its fruit shape and gravitas but not roughness or austerity; and it has overtones which bring light and shade to the wine via faint notes of smoke, of cleansing bitterness, of the saltiness which is such a hallmark of parts of Crozes, and of the 'stony' flavours which lovers of terroir wine crave.  A gorgeous success. Score - 93. (Andrew Jefford, decanter.com, July 18, 2016)

Wine 1

The single-vineyard 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Sugarille has a tighter core and a blacker heart compared to the Rennina. This wine is momentarily more difficult to penetrate and comprehend. It makes a more abrupt first impression but then relaxes and reveals more of its character only after it has spent extra time in your company. Then, it becomes suddenly exuberant and loud. This is a dynamic expression of Sangiovese with bold ripe fruit, spice and balsam notes to carry it forward during cellar aging. This vintage offers firmness and strength. Drink Date: 2020-2037.  Score - 94. (Monica Larner, robertparker.com, Feb. 28, 2018)

Wine 2

The 2012 Brunello di Montalcino Riserva Poggio al Vento is a monumental wine from this storied appellation in southern Tuscany. From a warm vintage, this is a deeply textured, rich and succulent rendition of Sangiovese. You taste the exuberant flavors of sun-drenched fruit. However, you also taste some evolution (remember, we are talking about a wine released seven years after the harvest) with tarry notes of toasted spice, licorice and Spanish cedar. This wine ages in large oak casks (of various sizes) for four years followed by an additional two years in bottle. We can look forward to more bottle evolution as the wine moves forward in time. Some 20,000 bottles were made. Drink Date: 2020-2040.  Score - 95. (Monica Larner, robertparker.com, Jan. 31, 2019)

Made with fruit from a slightly cooler site, the 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Filo di Seta takes a few minutes to open but is well worth the wait.

It's like meeting a person for the first time who initially seems shy, but then who suddenly moves in for the big bear hug. Its disposition is as generous as it is genuine.

There are few Brunello vintages afforded more attention in the last 10-plus, certainly '04 and '06, increasingly better even from '08 and looking forward towards what greatness will come in 2015. Yes but not solely magnified through the lens of patience and bottle time, from 2010 La Mannella has coupled upon and layered over itself like compressed fruit and puff pastry. Though it begs for drink now attention, another seven years will be needed before it can safely be labeled as uncoiled and to reveal all that is wrapped so tight. Rich is not the operative but unmistakeable as Cortonesi it is; that natural clay soil funk of resolution and fully hydrated chalk. This is to sangiovese as Les Preuses Grand Cru Chablis or Rangen Grand Cru Alsace are to Riesling.

Wine 1

A little juicier and riper than what you may expect from Ontario if you're used to drinking Red from Niagara. It's fantastic when you see the Lake Erie North Shore appellation on the bottle.

Wine 2

LENS (Lake Erie North Shore) has a long growing season that permits the grapes to develop ripe, full-flavoured fruit while maintaining the balance integral to fine wines. The warm temperatures allow winemakers in LENS a great range of varietals to work with. Syrah, which loves the sun and warmth, thrives there. This one is soft and approachable, with complex suggestions of red and black fruit, chocolate, toast, cured meat and black pepper spice. Perfect for burgers or ribs. (Vintages panel, March 2018)

Immediately appealing from the first sip, showing flavours of ripe raspberry, plum and red fruit with notes of earth and spice.

Wine 2

The 2015 Cabernet Sauvignon Feather is lovely, unfurling in the glass with aromas of cassis, blackberries, petroleum jelly and burning embers. On the palate, it's full-bodied, ripe and powerful, with an expansive attack and an ample core of dark berry fruit, underpinned by a fine-grained, stony chassis of ripe tannins. This wine is made by Howell Mountain veteran Randy Dunn, and its profile - while marked by the torrid 2015 vintage - will be familiar to followers of the wines he produces there.

The 'black label' vineyards are situated in Pacs del Penedès, close to Vilafranca: 29ha of unirrigated Cabernet Sauvignon on alluvial soils over sand and clay, generally harvested at the end of September ... It's dark in colour, fragrant and enticing on the nose, and svelte, poised and finally melting on the palate ... the fruits have a rounded unction - it has more texture and structural depth as well as refinement. It's very 'solar' and Mediterranean, yet there's a rich fleshiness to this Cabernet ... Drink 2018-2030. Score - 94. (Andrew Jefford, decanter.com, June 24, 2018)

If you were to come back as a vine, Jerry Seps's steep hillside vineyard would be a pretty tempting place to put down roots. His vineyard faces north toward Mount St. Helena and east toward the Palisades?not a house or a road in sight, only trees, meadows and craggy rocks left by the volcano. Ideally, you'd come back as a zinfandel vine. The vineyard's cool morning sun and volcanic soils grow zin with racy energy, a sensation that's captured beautifully in this 2013. With air, the wine transforms all of its blueberry flavor, peachy red fruit and youthful oak into something finer, opening over the course of several days toward mouthwatering flavors of fresh-picked black raspberries and bright, rustic mineral notes that seem patterned after the volcanic rock.

This wine punches above its weight [at this price point] - the luscious black cherry and hedgerow fruits do a good job of making it seem twice the price. Sultry black pepper, sweet spice, baked strawberry, currants and liquorice all mingle in the swirling, inky sea. This is deep, but is supple rather than dense. Drinking Window: 2017-2022. Score - 92.

Grown on the Lopresti Vineyard at the southern end of McLaren Vale, east of Port Willunga. Matured in used French oak for 12 months. Red fruits prominent on the bouquet, with cherry and raspberry in the mix, along with a suggestion of stewed rhubarb and a slightly earthy undertone. Just lightish medium weight on the palate, the fruit tending to be more savoury than sweet, and the astringency of acid and tannin nicely in balance. Drink By: 2024. Score - 89.

Deep red. Ripe, mineral-tinged red berry and cherry scents, along with a hint of succulent herbs and building spiciness. Smooth and open-knit, showing very good depth to the bitter cherry and black raspberry flavors, which take on a smoky quality with aeration.

Winemaker Alexandrine Roy selected the finest 15 barrels of wines made from estate fruit in 2014 for this wine. Harvest Brix 23.8º. Clones are Pommard, 115 and 777. Native yeast fermentation. Aged in French oak barrels, 25% new. Moderately light reddish purple color in the glass. The nose is remarkably complex, offering scents of dark red and black cherry and berry, rose petal, aged leather, and turned earth. A noticeable contrast to the 'Beehive' bottling, with more structure, more savory and earthy facets, less flashy fruit, and slightly more oak contribution at this young age. A very sophisticated wine that is clearly built to age. The mid weight flavors of black raspberry and blackberry are set off by notes of spice and toast and emerge slowly in the glass over time. The finish is uncommonly generous as all great wines are. When tasted several hours later, the wine was more giving, indicating that it should be decanted if drunk now, but will benefit from more time in the cellar. Still evolving when tasted from an opened bottle two days later. Enjoy this one for its complexity and longevity.  Score - 96. (William Gaffney, princeofpinot.com, Feb. 1, 2017)
