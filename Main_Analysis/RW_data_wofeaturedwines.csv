V552851,220.0,Beringer Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2013,"One of the great efforts of recent years, and not surprisingly so, is the 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon Private Reserve, a blend of 81% from Howell Mountain, 11% from St. Helena and the rest Calistoga and Mount Veeder. It is a blend of 96% Cabernet Sauvignon 3% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot aged 20 months in 84% new French oak. At 15.2% natural alcohol, this is a big boy, but also classic Napa Cabernet Sauvignon with crème de cassis, graphite, licorice, and a touch of spicy oak. Winemaker Laurie Hook, who has since departed as winemaker, really hit a home run with this beauty. The wine could benefit from 7-10 years cellaring and probably last 30 to 40. When all is said and done, this is an instant classic, the wine full-bodied with oodles of crème de cassis, pen ink, graphite and baking spices.

The yields came in at 51 hectoliters per hectare and it is matured in 75% new oak and 25% one-year-old barrels, the final alcohol level 13.3%. It has a beautifully defined, very detailed bouquet with mineral-rich black fruit laced with cedar and graphite notes, living up to its nom de plume as the 'Pauillac of Margaux.' The palate is simply the best that I have ever tasted at the estate, without question. This has presence, but also weightlessness, filigree tannin and perfectly pitched acidity, with real intensity and drive. The tension here is outstanding and the persistence is incredibly long. It is not the showiest of all the 2016s by a long stretch, and yet it is everything you could possibly want from a Margaux. Like Beychevelle this year, the 2016 Brane-Cantenac puts recent vintages in the shade, thanks not only to the growing season, but also a new punching down system in their gravity-fed winery that was completed in 2015.

The classic wet rock, creme de cassis, subtle oak and gravelly stoniness of the vineyard come through in this spectacular, full-bodied, gorgeously pure and intense effort.

The 2006 Château La Conseillante had perhaps the most show-stopping bouquet out of all seventy-odd 2006s that I tasted at ten years. It explodes from the glass with raspberry coulis, kirsch, honey and marmalade, so much so that I am not sure if I would nail it as a Bordeaux, let alone a Pomerol! It is precocious and very attractive. The palate is medium-bodied with succulent ripe red cherry and strawberry fruit, plenty of black truffle, fine tannin and well-judged acidity. This is an opulent, decadent La Conseillante that is atypical of the vintage and yet you totally fall for its charms. What it might lack in subtlety, it makes up for in sheer charm.

Frankly, it may turn out to be as good as the 2005, which in all of Bordeaux is a far greater vintage than 2006.

The palate is medium-bodied with tannins that gently grip the mouth, tertiary notes on the entry, fine acidity vis-à-vis the fruit, then a slight tarriness towards the broody black fruit on the saline, marine-influenced finish.

It was picked between from 27-30 September for the young vines, then the picking team stopped, restarting on 3 October with the Merlot and the Cabernets finished on 12 October. This vintage is matured in 75% new oak. It has a very concentrated, almost opaque bouquet that required some coaxing from the glass, developing floral and crushed limestone scents with time: disarmingly fresh and with stunning vivacity. The palate is concentrated and tannic, although they are not obtrusive and appear neatly embroidered into the multi-layered black fruit. This is a classic Lynch Bages with ambition and recalls vintages like 1990, a Lynch Bages built for long-term ageing. That arching backbone is counterbalanced by the keen line of acidity and a freshness that knows no bounds. There is ethereal delineation and tension on the finish, but I would give this at least ten years in bottle to enjoy this audacious Lynch Bages at its peak. Maybe the biggest surprise of the vintage, this has all the makings of a sensational wine. Drink Date: 2026-2060. Score - 97-99.

There is a sense of bravura here, of aristocracy. The palate is medium-bodied with sumptuous black fruit, perhaps beginning to soften in texture, one or two years off its plateau. There are layers and layers of black fruit intermingling with graphite and black pepper, and it wisely reins everything in on the finish that is more classic in style and in keeping with the vintage.

V10775,499.0,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 1986,"Now at 30 years of age, there is a gulf between the two Pichons in this vintage that no longer exists. The 1986 Pichon-Longueville Comtesse de Lalande has long been one of the best wines from the estate alongside the 1982 (even if the first bottle was a little oxidized). The second bottle was representative. It has a classic pencil-lead, cedar-infused nose that rockets from the glass, a subtle floral note developing with time. The palate is medium-bodied with supple red berry fruit, a pinch of white pepper and cedar, structured compared to coeval vintages and perhaps further along its drinking plateau than previous examples. Certainly à point, I would be reaching for bottles of this now if you cannot locate those 1982s, or alternatively seek out the superlative 1996.

It is hard to choose a favorite, although the 1995 is a smoother, more immediately sexy and accessible wine. It is an exquisite example of Pichon-Lalande with the Merlot component giving the wine a coffee/chocolatey/cherry component to go along with the Cabernet Sauvignon's and Cabernet Franc's complex blackberry/cassis fruit. The wine possesses an opaque black/ruby/purple color, and sexy, flamboyant aromatics of pain grille, black fruits, and cedar.

V554220,365.0,Château Pichon Longueville Comtesse de Lalande 2010,"The 2010 Pichon Lalande is performing extremely well and at the top of the range I predicted several years ago. A final blend dominated much more by Cabernet Sauvignon than usual (66% Cabernet Sauvignon, 24% Merlot, 7% Cabernet Franc and the rest Petit Verdot), the wine is a tighter, more tannic and structured version of this famed Pauillac, which often tends to have more of a St-Julien-like personality than most Pauillacs. Structured, backward and tannic, yet showing a fat mid-palate that is more savory, broader and more expansive than I remember from barrel, this wine is somewhat reminiscent of the 1986, given the Cabernet Sauvignon domination of the blend. Full-bodied, impressively endowed, and less sexy and velvety than normal, this is a somewhat different style of Pichon Lalande than most readers have been used to. Whether you like it more or less will depend on your point of view, but this wine, unlike most Pichon Lalandes, needs a good 5-7 years of cellaring and should keep for 30+ years.

It was certainly showing well when I stopped by the chateau in January. Opaque purple, with loads of charcoal, licorice, incense and some exotic Asian spices along with abundant cassis liqueur, blackberry and hints of roasted coffee and spring flowers, it is full-bodied and opulent, with relatively high tannins, but they have sweetened up considerably and seem less aggressive than they did from barrel. The oak is clearly pushed to the background by the wine's wealth of fruit, glycerin and full-bodied texture.

The wine aged for some 22 months in French barriques, half of them new. Despite the warmer year, the 2015s are the freshest wines I remember from Errázuriz.

This is a spicier expression with some varietal aromas, violets, raspberry leaves and sour cherries. The palate is completely dry and lively, with very fine tannins and a supple finish.

The bottled wine contains perhaps 15% Malbec in the blend, and they will soon stop mentioning Cabernet Franc on the label. It fermented in 500-liter oak barrels with 50% of the Cabernet Franc and all of the Malbec and then matured in used oak foudres. It's very intense and powerful, but at the same time, there is a kind of lightness on the palate that makes if feel light on its feet but with great inner power. There is citrus acidity that makes it effervescent and electric. It has some 7.5 grams of acidity and a pH of 3.45, very healthy parameters. The peppery character appears after some time, giving it a Chinon-like twist, and it also reminds me of my favorite Bordeaux, Pomerol's Lafleur. This is definitely world-class and worth lying down, as it should develop further complexity in bottle.

In an impressive acrobatic move, the full-bodied palate feels impressively buoyant thanks to the lifting acidity. Slightly gravelly tannins nicely counter the lightly gummy texture. There's a compelling umami meatiness and sanguine hint on the medium-plus finish that seems to demand dry-aged rib-eye, though with this lovely balance and excellent depth of character, it will pleasantly partner any cut of steak.

Playing against the type of that Apartment role, he became the warm-hearted dad in the long-running 1960s TV series My Three Sons. But I digress. MacMurray had a cattle-and-crop ranch in northern California, a gorgeous site not open to visitors. The actor, who died in 1991 before vines were planted on the estate, could not have envisioned that the area would become the wine paradise it is now.

It comes in at 14% alcohol. In a way, noting that the vintage years were rather different, this is a replay of the 2016 Little Odisseia, except with a bit better depth and structure. It retains the same elegance and silky feel, now leaning to Burgundy, and the same fresh fruit. The flavors are still vivid but even a little more controlled, no doubt due to the subtle wood impact. This is not a big, fat and powerful Reserva, but it is a wonderfully graceful and tasty one. I was willing to lean up a bit on Little Odisseia. For the moment, this irresistible Reserva deserves the same consideration. It can hold reasonably well, but it isn't likely to develop a lot with extended aging.

The vines range from 30 to 90 years old, and like the rest, they are organically farmed. The destemmed and crushed grapes fermented in oak vats with indigenous yeasts and pigéage. It underwent malolactic in barrique and then matured in larger oak casks for 18 months. Again, there is a difference in precision, brightness and depth from la Montesa to this Propiedad. This is, in Palacios's mind, an old-vine cuvée from Alfaro. The palate combines juicy fruit with earthy tones, very fine tannins and balsamic, Mediterranean herbs and a tasty, almost salty finish.

Clones are Pommard, 115 and 777. Native yeast fermentation. Aged in French oak barrels, 25% new. Moderately light reddish purple color in the glass. The nose is remarkably complex, offering scents of dark red and black cherry and berry, rose petal, aged leather, and turned earth. A noticeable contrast to the 'Beehive' bottling, with more structure, more savory and earthy facets, less flashy fruit, and slightly more oak contribution at this young age. A very sophisticated wine that is clearly built to age. The mid weight flavors of black raspberry and blackberry are set off by notes of spice and toast and emerge slowly in the glass over time. The finish is uncommonly generous as all great wines are. When tasted several hours later, the wine was more giving, indicating that it should be decanted if drunk now, but will benefit from more time in the cellar. Still evolving when tasted from an opened bottle two days later. Enjoy this one for its complexity and longevity.  Score - 96.

In this vintage, 46% of the clusters fermented with the stems in small, 2,000-liter oak foudres. Malolactic fermentation was carried out in used French oak barrels and the wine was aged for 21 months in second-use French oak barriques: no new oak was used at all. 2012 is really impressive; the word that comes to mind is precision.

It is rewarding to see that the range is on song. This is extremely delicate, yet in a way forceful, with pumice-like, powdery tannins defining a pinot of riveting, cerebral texture. It is across this spider web of chiffon that sour red cherry, strawberry, vanilla and satsuma plum have their way, ever so gradually seeping across the textural, taut mid-palate. An excellent first cab off the rank, strongly reminiscent of mid-tier Burgundy. This will age very well, belying its initial lighter complexion. Drink By: 2028.  Score - 94.

The styles are radically different. This, too, has plenty of power, but the very concentrated and very ripe mid-palate gives this a different feel - more luscious, richer and not as hard-edged. The oak gives it more cream and a more one-dimensional demeanor at first, to be sure. Still, as I played with this and let it air out, it seemed increasingly impressive. The finish became tinged with some beefy nuances and the aromatics began to show something besides wood. It seems to handle its alcohol perfectly. This has some things to prove in the cellar.

Here they aim for black fruit character while the regular Roda should show red fruit. The grapes are sourced from over 30-year-old vines and is mostly Tempranillo with some 5% Graciano. It matured in first and second use French oak barrels for 16 months. It's a warm vintage, without reaching the heights of 2011, but there was some stress in the peak of the summer, which in some wines might have provided some dry tannins. The advantage of old vines is that they are able to absorb these effects. There was some rain in September that might have saved the vintage. In general, everybody talks about a very healthy vintage, but again the challenge is to keep the freshness. The nose shows those aromas of thyme and rosemary, with dark fruit, ripe and a bit heady.

This is a smaller lot and the oak is more noticeable, and it should show better after some more time in the bottle.

V555110,4250.0,Solaia 2014,"The 2014 Solaia will be released during the second half of 2017. This is a fine-tuned expression that shows a focused sense of detail and careful attention. The quota of Cabernet Franc has been upped by a hair and this makes a big difference, especially in terms of the wine's bouquet. Otherwise, this celebrated Tuscan blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese. It opens to dark fruit aromas with crushed mineral, pipe tobacco, pressed flower and toasted spice. Its appearance is midnight black and profound. The wine delivers a sense of sheer excitement and nervousness that will subside with another few years of bottle age. Nonetheless, I think a certain amount of that bright edginess or rigidness will always be part of this cool vintage Solaia. In the mouth, the wine is firm, compact and dense. The tannins are chiseled to the point of sublime integration. Marchesi Antinori made 40% less Solaia in this vintage in order to maintain the quality you taste here. Drink Date: 2019-2035.

V987586,316.95,Solaia 2015,"There is a magical infinity, a continuous loop of compatibilities, between the icon wines of Tuscany and the 2015 vintage. The stunning 2015 Solaia is solid evidence of this perfect alignment. This was a warm vintage that shows less favorably in my opinion in different parts of Italy and with other grapes that render their most elegant performances in the cooler vintages. I would put pure expressions of Nebbiolo and Sangiovese in this category. However, Tuscany and many of her great blended reds (made partially or fully with international grapes) operate according to a different logic. To me, their maximum expression comes when you can taste that Tuscan sunshine beaming from within. Its rays are brilliant and warm. They shine across the senses with opulence and intensity. The very name Solaia evokes the concept of sunshine and this unique Tuscan wine archetype I am referring to. With the 2015 vintage, Solaia is liquid sunshine not just in name but also in fact. The bouquet is immediately soft and sensual with dark fruit, spice and sweet tobacco. The mouthfeel shows intensity and power, but you don't get any heavy residue from the dry extract (measured at 33 grams per liter). Indeed, the wine feels glossy, tonic and fresh. It is composed of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and a tiny part Cabernet Franc. There is a bit of crunch or snap that comes thanks to the more acidity-prone Sangiovese grape (the wine measures 3.5 in pH). Finally, the tannins are beautifully sweet and ripe. This wine is meticulously executed, and the 2015 vintage lives up to an ideal of what we imagine Solaia to be. It will be released about a week after this review is published. Drink Date: 2020-2050.

In this wine, from the joint venture with U.S. importer Eric Solomon that started in 1999, they used part of full clusters and sourced the grapes from Casa Marta, a nine-hectare, head-pruned, dry-farmed plot on very stony soils in the north of Yecla at the foot of the Mount Arabí. It fermented in concrete vats and open-top barrels and matured in barrique, each variety separately, for some ten months, after which it was blended and bottled. This is the vintage of the big change in this wine, where, as with the majority of its siblings, there is better balance and more integrated oak, more freshness and better balance. The nose is quite captivating, especially after some time in the glass, when it starts developing some floral aromas, perfect ripeness, no warmth or alcohol and a powerful, yet terribly balanced palate with concentration and elegance, fine-grained tannins and clean, focused flavors.

Estate cabernet of such acumen is predicated on the sound wisdom gathered by a viticulturist and Vineland's Roman Prydatkewycz knows his cabernet. Winemaker Brian Schmidt takes this paradigmatic escarpment fruit, passes it through the optimal sorter, removes five to eight per cent imperfect berries and a quarter of the cabernet sauvignon fruit.

What emerges is a naturally sweet, vegetal-void elixir, sharp, focused, fervently nervous, tart and captured as if in a dark vacuum or void. It's all tied inside snug, concentrated and intense.

The wine is 100% Grenache, from 15 different parcels, that was put into a barrel, then the entire barrel was put into a concrete tank, which was then filled with wine. This is a take on the underwater aging process that some people experiment with, and the result is that's there's no exposure to oxygen whatsoever, and the wine was kept like this for five years, with no racking or topping (since there's no evaporation, it never needed to be topped). Inky purple in color, with a sensational, youthful bouquet of crushed flowers, blueberries, blackberries, cured meats and spice, it hits the palate with incredible richness, a thick, unctuous mid-palate and ripe, yet present tannin. It's a singular, exotic beauty that I wish every reader could taste! I've not a clue how it will age, given its crazy elevage, yet I suspect it will benefit from short-term cellaring and keep for two to three decades!

Within the Piedra Infinita vineyard they look for the soils that have some 30 to 50 centimeters of soil before getting to the limestone, so the ripening is more harmonious and the palate gains in volume and shows some meat before getting to the chalky, limestone tannins. It really improves with time in the glass and in this vintage it seems to combine elegance with length; there is more texture and, in fact, it feels built around texture and acidity.

It was mainly planted with malbec in 2011, and the idea with this wine is to let the terroir come through, with little interference during vinification. This red is fermented using 70% of the whole cluster, and aged in cement, which - according to Sebastian Zuccardi - provides the structure that malbec lacks. As an additional result, Zuccardi says it decreases the alcohol content, which is always appreciated in a sunny place like Mendoza. The result is a wine with glorious taste of red fruits, rich in herbal and mineral notes, and in violets. It has a fine structure, but intense and firm at the same time. A delicate wine like few others. This wine debuted (with purchased grapes) in 2014. Since 2015, Zuccardi has been working with his own very young vineyard, but the work at the structure level is noticeable. At its first harvest, it was a delicious, simple wine, that changed the vision of malbec and offered a juicy version with alcohol levels of around twelve. It currently maintains that level (San Pablo is very cold), but now, in addition to showing that fruit, it shows the structure of a more important wine Score - 97.
