It seems like yesterday that the 2001 was released and now the 2008 Viña Ardanza is already here. This is the first vintage when they have been able to use the fruit from their new Garnacha vineyards in the village of Tudelilla (Rioja Baja), La Pedriza, which represents 20% of the blend complementing the majority of Tempranillo. The wine was put in barrel in March 2009, separately; the Tempranillo was in four-year-old barrels for 36 months with six rackings, and the Garnacha in second and third use barrels for 30 months with five rackings. Vintages might go fast, but the wine does not feel too young, which was my fear. There are notes of stewed meat, cured leather, cloves, other spices and an overall balsamic character. The palate feels solid, consistent, nicely built, with abundant tannins and good balancing acidity. This should stand up to food and be able to develop in bottle. Drink Date: 2017-2023. Score - 93.

He was brilliant in 1944's Double Indemnity, directed by Billy Wilder, and went on to the more memorable, bittersweet 1960 Wilder comedy The Apartment, with Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon. Playing against the type of that Apartment role, he became the warm-hearted dad in the long-running 1960s TV series My Three Sons. But I digress. MacMurray had a cattle-and-crop ranch in northern California, a gorgeous site not open to visitors. The actor, who died in 1991 before vines were planted on the estate, could not have envisioned that the area would become the wine paradise it is now. So this is not a 'celebrity wine' in today's sense. But it's probably just as good as a lot of stuff that will be poured at many an Oscar-night bash in Los Angeles next month.

It underwent malolactic in barrique and then matured in larger oak casks for 18 months. Again, there is a difference in precision, brightness and depth from la Montesa to this Propiedad. This is, in Palacios's mind, an old-vine cuvée from Alfaro. The palate combines juicy fruit with earthy tones, very fine tannins and balsamic, Mediterranean herbs and a tasty, almost salty finish. Transparent, subtle and delicious, with some hints of the wines from yesteryear. For Palacios, this should be the typical wine from Alfaro - and a very good one at that! 40,000 bottles produced.

'Those sites brought some freshness to the wines. They are fresher and livelier than what we saw from the other warm vintages.' She also notes that the oak usage dropped quite a bit in 2016, down to about 19%-23% from 20%-40%. Pale to medium ruby-purple in color, the 2016 Pinot Noir Willamette Valley opens with just the slightest touch of gunflint-like reduction on the nose, giving way to red cherries, cranberries and warm raspberry with underlying suggestions of pink peppercorn and flowers. Light to medium-bodied, it gives up great layers of warm red and blue fruits with earthy accents of forest floor, wet earth and bark.

In this vintage, 46% of the clusters fermented with the stems in small, 2,000-liter oak foudres. Malolactic fermentation was carried out in used French oak barrels and the wine was aged for 21 months in second-use French oak barriques: no new oak was used at all. 2012 is really impressive; the word that comes to mind is precision.

It is rewarding to see that the range is on song. This is extremely delicate, yet in a way forceful, with pumice-like, powdery tannins defining a pinot of riveting, cerebral texture. It is across this spider web of chiffon that sour red cherry, strawberry, vanilla and satsuma plum have their way, ever so gradually seeping across the textural, taut mid-palate. An excellent first cab off the rank, strongly reminiscent of mid-tier Burgundy. This will age very well, belying its initial lighter complexion. Drink By: 2028.  Score - 94.

It matured in first and second use French oak barrels for 16 months. It's a warm vintage, without reaching the heights of 2011, but there was some stress in the peak of the summer, which in some wines might have provided some dry tannins. The advantage of old vines is that they are able to absorb these effects. There was some rain in September that might have saved the vintage. In general, everybody talks about a very healthy vintage, but again the challenge is to keep the freshness. The nose shows those aromas of thyme and rosemary, with dark fruit, ripe and a bit heady.

The wine is also powerful at 15% alcohol, keeping some six grams of acidity and coming through a little oaky as it fermented in brand new 225-liter French barriques where it underwent malolactic and 16 months élevage. This is a smaller lot and the oak is more noticeable, and it should show better after some more time in the bottle.

The quota of Cabernet Franc has been upped by a hair and this makes a big difference, especially in terms of the wine's bouquet. Otherwise, this celebrated Tuscan blend is mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese. It opens to dark fruit aromas with crushed mineral, pipe tobacco, pressed flower and toasted spice. Its appearance is midnight black and profound. The wine delivers a sense of sheer excitement and nervousness that will subside with another few years of bottle age. Nonetheless, I think a certain amount of that bright edginess or rigidness will always be part of this cool vintage Solaia. In the mouth, the wine is firm, compact and dense.

V987586,316.95,Solaia 2015,"There is a magical infinity, a continuous loop of compatibilities, between the icon wines of Tuscany and the 2015 vintage. The stunning 2015 Solaia is solid evidence of this perfect alignment. This was a warm vintage that shows less favorably in my opinion in different parts of Italy and with other grapes that render their most elegant performances in the cooler vintages. I would put pure expressions of Nebbiolo and Sangiovese in this category. However, Tuscany and many of her great blended reds (made partially or fully with international grapes) operate according to a different logic. To me, their maximum expression comes when you can taste that Tuscan sunshine beaming from within. Its rays are brilliant and warm. They shine across the senses with opulence and intensity. The very name Solaia evokes the concept of sunshine and this unique Tuscan wine archetype I am referring to. With the 2015 vintage, Solaia is liquid sunshine not just in name but also in fact. The bouquet is immediately soft and sensual with dark fruit, spice and sweet tobacco. The mouthfeel shows intensity and power, but you don't get any heavy residue from the dry extract (measured at 33 grams per liter). Indeed, the wine feels glossy, tonic and fresh. It is composed of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and a tiny part Cabernet Franc. There is a bit of crunch or snap that comes thanks to the more acidity-prone Sangiovese grape (the wine measures 3.5 in pH). Finally, the tannins are beautifully sweet and ripe. This wine is meticulously executed, and the 2015 vintage lives up to an ideal of what we imagine Solaia to be. It will be released about a week after this review is published. Drink Date: 2020-2050.

It fermented in concrete vats and open-top barrels and matured in barrique, each variety separately, for some ten months, after which it was blended and bottled. This is the vintage of the big change in this wine, where, as with the majority of its siblings, there is better balance and more integrated oak, more freshness and better balance.

The wine is 100% Grenache, from 15 different parcels, that was put into a barrel, then the entire barrel was put into a concrete tank, which was then filled with wine. This is a take on the underwater aging process that some people experiment with, and the result is that's there's no exposure to oxygen whatsoever, and the wine was kept like this for five years, with no racking or topping (since there's no evaporation, it never needed to be topped). Inky purple in color, with a sensational, youthful bouquet of crushed flowers, blueberries, blackberries, cured meats and spice, it hits the palate with incredible richness, a thick, unctuous mid-palate and ripe, yet present tannin. It's a singular, exotic beauty that I wish every reader could taste! I've not a clue how it will age, given its crazy elevage, yet I suspect it will benefit from short-term cellaring and keep for two to three decades!

Within the Piedra Infinita vineyard they look for the soils that have some 30 to 50 centimeters of soil before getting to the limestone, so the ripening is more harmonious and the palate gains in volume and shows some meat before getting to the chalky, limestone tannins. It really improves with time in the glass and in this vintage it seems to combine elegance with length; there is more texture and, in fact, it feels built around texture and acidity. I think this is a real triumph over the natural conditions of the year. This is what the people who ask what comes after Malbec should get: expression of a place through the grape.

V568915,29.95,Zuccardi Polígonos Malbec 2016,"(Translated from the Spanish) The San Pablo vineyard is located 1400 meters above sea level, in the foothills of the Andes. It was mainly planted with malbec in 2011, and the idea with this wine is to let the terroir come through, with little interference during vinification. This red is fermented using 70% of the whole cluster, and aged in cement, which - according to Sebastian Zuccardi - provides the structure that malbec lacks. As an additional result, Zuccardi says it decreases the alcohol content, which is always appreciated in a sunny place like Mendoza. The result is a wine with glorious taste of red fruits, rich in herbal and mineral notes, and in violets. It has a fine structure, but intense and firm at the same time. A delicate wine like few others. This wine debuted (with purchased grapes) in 2014. Since 2015, Zuccardi has been working with his own very young vineyard, but the work at the structure level is noticeable. At its first harvest, it was a delicious, simple wine, that changed the vision of malbec and offered a juicy version with alcohol levels of around twelve. It currently maintains that level (San Pablo is very cold), but now, in addition to showing that fruit, it shows the structure of a more important wine Score - 97.
