Beautiful layers of fruit, velvety more noticeable tannin, exquisite purity and an almost endless finish make for a remarkable effort that needs another 5-6 years of cellaring and should keep 30 to 40+ years, particularly in view of how Eiseles from the early 1970s have lasted.

209,V552851,220,Beringer Private Reserve Cabernet Sauvignon 2013,"One of the great efforts of recent years, and not surprisingly so, is the 2013 Cabernet Sauvignon Private Reserve, a blend of 81% from Howell Mountain, 11% from St. Helena and the rest Calistoga and Mount Veeder. It is a blend of 96% Cabernet Sauvignon 3% Cabernet Franc and 1% Petit Verdot aged 20 months in 84% new French oak. At 15.2% natural alcohol, this is a big boy, but also classic Napa Cabernet Sauvignon with cr?me de cassis, graphite, licorice, and a touch of spicy oak. Winemaker Laurie Hook, who has since departed as winemaker, really hit a home run with this beauty. The wine could benefit from 7-10 years cellaring and probably last 30 to 40. When all is said and done, this is an instant classic, the wine full-bodied with oodles of cr?me de cassis, pen ink, graphite and baking spices. It is multi-dimensional, layered, and one of the all-time great Beringer Private Reserves - and there have been many. Drink Date: 2023-2066.  Score - 97.

The classic wet rock, creme de cassis, subtle oak and gravelly stoniness of the vineyard come through in this spectacular, full-bodied, gorgeously pure and intense effort.

The wine aged for some 22 months in French barriques, half of them new. Despite the warmer year, the 2015s are the freshest wines I remember from Err?zuriz. They were able to harvest earlier, and all the wines feel very fresh; in the Syrah, they have low yields and stopped pushing for more ripeness and keeping the vines with enough water so they don't get stressed. This is a spicier expression with some varietal aromas, violets, raspberry leaves and sour cherries. The palate is completely dry and lively, with very fine tannins and a supple finish.

It was not an easy year; they had to do a strict selection of grapes, and it paid off. It has the character of the variety, with its elegant rusticity with a fresh, herbal twist and a palate with fine-grained tannins, nicely textured and with a supple, very tasty finish.

It retains the same elegance and silky feel, now leaning to Burgundy, and the same fresh fruit. The flavors are still vivid but even a little more controlled, no doubt due to the subtle wood impact. This is not a big, fat and powerful Reserva, but it is a wonderfully graceful and tasty one. I was willing to lean up a bit on Little Odisseia. For the moment, this irresistible Reserva deserves the same consideration. It can hold reasonably well, but it isn't likely to develop a lot with extended aging.

But, as it's selected from old vines in five plots in different 'parajes' - Valtomelloso, Valviejo, Las Mulgas and Corral de Serrano - it always has a small percentage of other traditional grape varieties. The vines range from 30 to 90 years old, and like the rest, they are organically farmed. The destemmed and crushed grapes fermented in oak vats with indigenous yeasts and pig?age. It underwent malolactic in barrique and then matured in larger oak casks for 18 months. Again, there is a difference in precision, brightness and depth from la Montesa to this Propiedad. This is, in Palacios's mind, an old-vine cuv?e from Alfaro. The palate combines juicy fruit with earthy tones, very fine tannins and balsamic, Mediterranean herbs and a tasty, almost salty finish. Transparent, subtle and delicious, with some hints of the wines from yesteryear. For Palacios, this should be the typical wine from Alfaro - and a very good one at that! 40,000 bottles produced.

Carlos San Pedro planted it with a massal selection that ripens quite early; in fact, in 2017 it was the first vineyard they harvested. It ripens properly and keeps good acidity.

Here they aim for black fruit character while the regular Roda should show red fruit. The grapes are sourced from over 30-year-old vines and is mostly Tempranillo with some 5% Graciano. It matured in first and second use French oak barrels for 16 months. It's a warm vintage, without reaching the heights of 2011, but there was some stress in the peak of the summer, which in some wines might have provided some dry tannins. The advantage of old vines is that they are able to absorb these effects. There was some rain in September that might have saved the vintage. In general, everybody talks about a very healthy vintage, but again the challenge is to keep the freshness. The nose shows those aromas of thyme and rosemary, with dark fruit, ripe and a bit heady. The palate is truly spicy, voluptuous and full, with dusty, fine tannins and a tasty finish. 99,661 bottles produced. Drink Date: 2016-2022. Score - 93.

2426,V987586,316.95,Solaia 2015,"There is a magical infinity, a continuous loop of compatibilities, between the icon wines of Tuscany and the 2015 vintage. The stunning 2015 Solaia is solid evidence of this perfect alignment. This was a warm vintage that shows less favorably in my opinion in different parts of Italy and with other grapes that render their most elegant performances in the cooler vintages. I would put pure expressions of Nebbiolo and Sangiovese in this category. However, Tuscany and many of her great blended reds (made partially or fully with international grapes) operate according to a different logic. To me, their maximum expression comes when you can taste that Tuscan sunshine beaming from within. Its rays are brilliant and warm. They shine across the senses with opulence and intensity. The very name Solaia evokes the concept of sunshine and this unique Tuscan wine archetype I am referring to. With the 2015 vintage, Solaia is liquid sunshine not just in name but also in fact. The bouquet is immediately soft and sensual with dark fruit, spice and sweet tobacco. The mouthfeel shows intensity and power, but you don't get any heavy residue from the dry extract (measured at 33 grams per liter). Indeed, the wine feels glossy, tonic and fresh. It is composed of mostly Cabernet Sauvignon with Sangiovese and a tiny part Cabernet Franc. There is a bit of crunch or snap that comes thanks to the more acidity-prone Sangiovese grape (the wine measures 3.5 in pH). Finally, the tannins are beautifully sweet and ripe. This wine is meticulously executed, and the 2015 vintage lives up to an ideal of what we imagine Solaia to be. It will be released about a week after this review is published. Drink Date: 2020-2050.

It fermented in concrete vats and open-top barrels and matured in barrique, each variety separately, for some ten months, after which it was blended and bottled. This is the vintage of the big change in this wine, where, as with the majority of its siblings, there is better balance and more integrated oak, more freshness and better balance. The nose is quite captivating, especially after some time in the glass, when it starts developing some floral aromas, perfect ripeness, no warmth or alcohol and a powerful, yet terribly balanced palate with concentration and elegance, fine-grained tannins and clean, focused flavors.

Inky purple in color, with a sensational, youthful bouquet of crushed flowers, blueberries, blackberries, cured meats and spice, it hits the palate with incredible richness, a thick, unctuous mid-palate and ripe, yet present tannin.

2884,V568915,29.95,Zuccardi Pol?gonos Malbec 2016,"(Translated from the Spanish) The San Pablo vineyard is located 1400 meters above sea level, in the foothills of the Andes. It was mainly planted with malbec in 2011, and the idea with this wine is to let the terroir come through, with little interference during vinification. This red is fermented using 70% of the whole cluster, and aged in cement, which - according to Sebastian Zuccardi - provides the structure that malbec lacks. As an additional result, Zuccardi says it decreases the alcohol content, which is always appreciated in a sunny place like Mendoza. The result is a wine with glorious taste of red fruits, rich in herbal and mineral notes, and in violets. It has a fine structure, but intense and firm at the same time. A delicate wine like few others. This wine debuted (with purchased grapes) in 2014. Since 2015, Zuccardi has been working with his own very young vineyard, but the work at the structure level is noticeable. At its first harvest, it was a delicious, simple wine, that changed the vision of malbec and offered a juicy version with alcohol levels of around twelve. It currently maintains that level (San Pablo is very cold), but now, in addition to showing that fruit, it shows the structure of a more important wine Score - 97.
