Beautiful layers of fruit, velvety more noticeable tannin, exquisite purity and an almost endless finish make for a remarkable effort that needs another 5-6 years of cellaring and should keep 30 to 40+ years, particularly in view of how Eiseles from the early 1970s have lasted.

They own a plot of very old Cariñena vines in the village of Torroja (all the rest of other vines are in the village of Vilella Alta where the winery is located), which is mixed with more Cariñena, Syrah and a pinch of Garnacha from different vineyards to make up a final blend of around 60% Cariñena, 35% Syrah and 5% Garnacha. I think vinification and élevage is now a secondary consideration for these Mas Alta wines because what I have in the glass is much more about the place, which to me makes the wine much more interesting. This is balsamic with notes hinting on camphor, but mainly rosemary, fennel and thyme with even a floral touch and a mixture of black and red berries and some spiciness thrown in.

V639930,13.95,Castaño Casa Carmela 2015,"The 2015 Casa Carmela, made in conjunction with their U.S. importer Eric Solomon, is a wine they wanted to reflect the long history of viticulture and tradition of the Monastrell grape from the Yecla Mediterranean region. It is fermented in stainless steel with part of whole clusters and indigenous yeasts, and the wine matured in mostly French and mostly used barriques for six months. This is the first vintage for this cuvée, and it's super classic but clean, with some French and American oak. There is obviously some meaty Mediterranean character that you get in the best Bandol but without any of the animal aromas. This is completely different from the entry-level Monastrell, earthier and with more tannins, in need of food. Again, the quality is mind-boggling for the price. Drink Date: 2018-2020.  Score - 90.

The palate is simply the best that I have ever tasted at the estate, without question. This has presence, but also weightlessness, filigree tannin and perfectly pitched acidity, with real intensity and drive. The tension here is outstanding and the persistence is incredibly long. It is not the showiest of all the 2016s by a long stretch, and yet it is everything you could possibly want from a Margaux.

It has a very linear bouquet, quite strict and intense with a light iodine and marine scent merging with the black fruit. This is a more 'aristocratic' nose for Clinet, sophisticated and one of the most nuanced I have encountered. The palate is medium-bodied with filigree tannin that forms the foundation of a more masculine Clinet, complex and focused with a subtle spiciness coming through on the finish, which fans out with confidence and leaves a disarming, saline tang in the mouth.

The proprietor is not alone in thinking this is the finest Ducru Beaucaillou since the 1961. The classic wet rock, creme de cassis, subtle oak and gravelly stoniness of the vineyard come through in this spectacular, full-bodied, gorgeously pure and intense effort.

When I tasted it from barrel, it reminded me of their successful 1988, but it is dramatically superior to that vintage. Frankly, it may turn out to be as good as the 2005, which in all of Bordeaux is a far greater vintage than 2006. Lafite's severe selection process (42% made it into the grand vin) resulted in a full-bodied wine boasting an extraordinary perfume of charcoal, truffles, lead pencil shavings, and sensationally sweet, ripe black currant and cedar notes.

It has a very pure, very attractive bouquet with ample blackberry, boysenberry, blueberry and fresh fig aromas, a little more extravagant than some other Pessac-Léognan 2016s, yet it maintains impressive control and focus. It develops more pressed flower aromas with time. The palate is medium-bodied with tannins that gently grip the mouth, tertiary notes on the entry, fine acidity vis-à-vis the fruit, then a slight tarriness towards the broody black fruit on the saline, marine-influenced finish. It is an intriguing take on the vintage, classic in style like many others, detailed with impressive complexity.

V668053,275.0,Château Lynch-Bages 2016,"The 2016 Lynch Bages is a blend of 75% Cabernet Sauvignon, 19% Merlot, 4% Cabernet Franc, 2% Petit Verdot with 13.7% alcohol and an IPT of 95, the highest ever for this property and probably one of the highest on the Left Bank this vintage. It was picked between from 27-30 September for the young vines, then the picking team stopped, restarting on 3 October with the Merlot and the Cabernets finished on 12 October. This vintage is matured in 75% new oak. It has a very concentrated, almost opaque bouquet that required some coaxing from the glass, developing floral and crushed limestone scents with time: disarmingly fresh and with stunning vivacity. The palate is concentrated and tannic, although they are not obtrusive and appear neatly embroidered into the multi-layered black fruit. This is a classic Lynch Bages with ambition and recalls vintages like 1990, a Lynch Bages built for long-term ageing. That arching backbone is counterbalanced by the keen line of acidity and a freshness that knows no bounds. There is ethereal delineation and tension on the finish, but I would give this at least ten years in bottle to enjoy this audacious Lynch Bages at its peak. Maybe the biggest surprise of the vintage, this has all the makings of a sensational wine. Drink Date: 2026-2060. Score - 97-99.

It offers everything you desire from this First Growth. It is blessed with breathtaking delineation and freshness on the nose, understated at first and then blossoming with mineral-infused black fruit, hints of blueberry, crushed stone and violet. The palate is perfectly balanced with filigree tannin, perfect acidity, a wine where everything seems to be in its right place. Blackberry, crushed stone at the front of the mouth, just a touch of spice towards the finish that shows supreme control. This is a Margaux that seems to light up the senses. It was outstanding in its youth...something that has not changed one bit over the intervening two decades. This may well turn out to be the Left Bank pinnacle of the 1990s. Tasted July 2016.

The palate is medium-bodied with silky smooth tannin, a fine bead of acidity, gentle and caressing but with a powerful, almost heady finish.

Loads of barbecue smoke, licorice, incense, blackberry, new saddle leather and forest floor notes jump from the glass of this dense, purple-colored wine. Extraordinarily intense and full-bodied, with plenty of tannin, but not the formidable structure of the 2010, this is going to be one of the longest-lived wines of 2008.

An opaque blue/black color suggests a wine with thrilling levels of concentration and intensity, and That's exactly what a taster gets. Subtle smoke, incense and Asian spice (soy?) notes interwoven with graphite, blueberry, blackberry and cassis characteristics lead to a full-bodied, phenomenally concentrated, viscous, opulent wine with plenty of sweet tannin.

Structured, backward and tannic, yet showing a fat mid-palate that is more savory, broader and more expansive than I remember from barrel, this wine is somewhat reminiscent of the 1986, given the Cabernet Sauvignon domination of the blend. Full-bodied, impressively endowed, and less sexy and velvety than normal, this is a somewhat different style of Pichon Lalande than most readers have been used to.

Deep in color, the nose is quite captivating with black fruit, brine and crushed stone. I like the strictness here -- very 1996 in style. The palate is medium-bodied with quite a svelte texture. The bead of acidity lends this tension although I found that finish surprisingly backward and just lacked that peacock's tail that would have warranted a higher score.

The hand-picked grapes were destemmed, crushed and fermented in stainless steel vats at temperatures ranging from 26 to 28 degrees Celsius. The wine aged for some 22 months in French barriques, half of them new. Despite the warmer year, the 2015s are the freshest wines I remember from Errázuriz. They were able to harvest earlier, and all the wines feel very fresh; in the Syrah, they have low yields and stopped pushing for more ripeness and keeping the vines with enough water so they don't get stressed. This is a spicier expression with some varietal aromas, violets, raspberry leaves and sour cherries. The palate is completely dry and lively, with very fine tannins and a supple finish. This is a more complete and deeper wine than the Aconcagua Costa Syrah, but I still like the style of the Coastal better. Drink Date: 2017-2023.  Score - 93.

The bottled wine contains perhaps 15% Malbec in the blend, and they will soon stop mentioning Cabernet Franc on the label. It fermented in 500-liter oak barrels with 50% of the Cabernet Franc and all of the Malbec and then matured in used oak foudres. It's very intense and powerful, but at the same time, there is a kind of lightness on the palate that makes if feel light on its feet but with great inner power. There is citrus acidity that makes it effervescent and electric. It has some 7.5 grams of acidity and a pH of 3.45, very healthy parameters. The peppery character appears after some time, giving it a Chinon-like twist, and it also reminds me of my favorite Bordeaux, Pomerol's Lafleur. This is definitely world-class and worth lying down, as it should develop further complexity in bottle. This is one of those wines where the only improvement I can think of is having magnums rather than bottles. Bravo! Some 3,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in March 2016. Drink Date: 2018-2030.

The 2015 Minervois la Liviniere Clos d'Ora is a blend of the region's four grapes, aged a year in oak and another year in bottle prior to release. It's certainly the most supple and creamy-textured of the 2015s from Bertrand, marrying red berries seamlessly with hints of coffee-tinged oak and resiny notes of native garrigue. Although full-bodied and undeniably ripe (the alcohol is 15.5% but there's no heat), it's far from monolithic, showcasing complexity and elegance rather than brute power. I've been deliberately conservative with my aging estimate because of the wine's lack of track record and relatively young vine age in the Syrah and Mourvèdre components, but I wouldn't be surprised to see it drink well for longer.
